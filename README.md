#Wordpress Themes and Plugins

This is repo contains work on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) themes and plugins.  It is based on a mirror of the svn repo at http://code.google.com/p/bitpress/ which comprises plugins and themes contributed by [Studio Cliffano](http://cliffano.com/).  This is not an official release of any of these projects and is currently only for my personal use (though the licenses allow you to use them too and, of course, feel free to fork).  No coordination has yet been made with cliffano and I have no control over the Wordpress.org version of Emptiness.  If cliffano resumes maintenance of Emptiness, this project may eventually diverge substantially from his releases.  Projects in this repo include:

##[Emptiness](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/emptiness)
"A minimalist theme with a white background, containing mostly texts with a header image. Simple and clean, with very lightweight HTML and CSS." 
Thru version 1.13.3 from cliffano, versions 1.14 and 1.15 previously committed by cliffano have not been released on Wordpress and are being moved to a development branch.

##Reflection
"A plugin which applies reflection effect to images with 'reflection' as one of the HTML attribute class values."
Thru version 0.3 from cliffano, development on this project is not planned.

##WP-Prnla
"A plugin which allows the use of Prnla http://prn.la as a shortlink / URL shortener."
This is a version 0.1 project of cliffano's that will not be further developed.

This repo contains the following main branches:

*`master` - a mirror of cliffano's work at http://code.google.com/p/bitpress/, as of 2013-02-08 this contained 2 revisions to Emptiness (his 1.14 and 1.15) that were not released on Wordrpess.org.  All work on master, other than a copy of this readme, was done by cliffano and it serves as more of an archive at this time.

*`stable` - my current release.  As of 2013-02-08, Emptiness is the same as on [Wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/emptiness), comprising only the releases of Emptiness thru 1.13.3.  The reasons for this are simple, I am running on 1.13.3 and don't want to upgrade to a version I haven't seen yet (I realize I can see it at http://cliffano.org).

*`develop` - my current work in progress; including, as of 2013-02-08, the review of cliffano's 1.14 and 1.15 for release.

There may also be other branches from time to time as I organize and over-organize my work and work on very short term branches, such as bug fixes.

Due to the release of 1.14 and 1.15 by cliffano only on googlecode, these revision numbers will ultimately be skipped and the next major revision from me will be 1.15+.  Additionally, if bugs are fixed before a 1.15+ release, they will be numbered 1.13.3+.
